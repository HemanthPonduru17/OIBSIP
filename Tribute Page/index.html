        <p>
          <b>Srinivasa Ramanujan</b> born Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar, (22
          December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician. Though he had almost no formal training in
          pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series,
          and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.During his
          short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations).Many
          were completely novel; his original and highly unconventional results, such as the Ramanujan prime, the
          Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock theta functions, have opened entire new areas of work
          and inspired a vast amount of further research.Of his thousands of results, all but a dozen or two have
          now been proven correct.

        <h2>Childhood and Education</h2>
        <p>
          Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887 into a Tamil
          Brahmin Iyengar family in Erode, in present-day Tamil Nadu.His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar,
          originally from Thanjavur district, worked as a clerk in a sari shop.His mother, Komalatammal, was a
          housewife and sang at a local temple.They lived in a small traditional home on Sarangapani Sannidhi
          Street in the town of Kumbakonam.

          On 1 October 1892, Ramanujan was enrolled at the local school.After his maternal grandfather lost his job
          as a court official in Kanchipuram,Ramanujan and his mother moved back to Kumbakonam, and he was enrolled
          in Kangayan Primary School.At Kangayan Primary School, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in
          November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography, and arithmetic with the best
          scores in the district.That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered
          formal mathematics for the first time.
          In 1903, when he was 16, Ramanujan obtained from a friend a library copy of A Synopsis of Elementary Results
          in Pure and Applied Mathematics, G. S. Carr's collection of 5,000 theorems.Ramanujan reportedly
          studied the contents of the book in detail.The next year, Ramanujan independently developed and
          investigated the Bernoulli numbers and calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant up to 15 decimal places.
          His peers at the time said they "rarely understood him" and "stood in respectful awe" of him.
